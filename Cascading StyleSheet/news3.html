                        MANILA, Philippines — <strong>A gradual increase in passenger capacities in railways and all forms of road-based
                            public
                            transport in Metro Manila will be implemented starting Nov. 4, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) announced
                            on
                            Friday.</strong>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The DOTr said the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) approved on
                        Thursday
                        the proposed initial expansion in capacity to 70 percent from the current 50 percent.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The one-month pilot implementation of the buildup will be adjusted until public utility vehicles (PUVs) reach their
                        full
                        capacity.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The DOTr—which earlier pushed for a return to 100-percent capacity, a proposal also backed by transport groups—said
                        it
                        would issue a memorandum to execute the IATF approval, which also authorized the department to later expand the
                        program
                        to other areas and other PUVs.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Even with the new policy, however, the DOTr reiterated that health and safety protocols would still be strictly
                        implemented inside PUVs.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <h2>Justification</h2>
                    Transportation Undersecretary Artemio Tuazon said the DOTr presented to the IATF its rapid analysis of the link between
                    COVID-19 cases and public transportation and a review of related literature in support of the proposal.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        It cited scientific studies in Vietnam and China and a report by the British Medical Journal to argue that “public
                        transport capacity has no significant correlation with the number of COVID-19 cases.”
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The DOTr said it suggested the capacity increase in response to the high demand for public transport following the
                        easing of quarantine restrictions and the reopening of more business establishments.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Mark Steven Pastor, assistant secretary for road transport and infrastructure, said the IATF approval would be a big
                        help to PUV drivers.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        “This is a welcome development considering the burden on our PUV drivers and operators of implementing the limited
                        passenger capacity rule, which was aggravated by recent fuel price hikes,” Pastor said.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <h2>Jeepney phaseout</h2>
                    Several transport groups earlier backed the DOTr proposal, but stressed that the capacity limit was just one of the
                    issues faced by distressed transport workers.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman in Quezon City, jeepney driver and UP Transport Group spokesperson
                        Nolan Grulla said many of them were still off the road due to the impending phaseout of old jeepney units.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Since June last year, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has been slowly reopening routes for
                        roadworthy PUVs with a valid and existing certificate of public convenience or have applied for an extension of its
                        validity.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        However, only drivers and operators who have consolidated their fleets for the government-mandated modernization
                        program
                        were tapped for the Libreng Sakay and PUV service contracting program.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        For drivers like him who could not afford the P1.6million to 2.4 million in loan to buy modern jeepneys, they have
                        to
                        deal with a low turnout of passengers due to route changes and the 50-percent capacity limit on public
                        transportation.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Grulla said drivers in six jeepney routes in UP were earning only P81 each trip due to the 50-percent capacity cap
                        that
                        allowed them to accommodate only nine passengers.
