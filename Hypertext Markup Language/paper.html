<p class=Default style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>One of the many favors about blockchain that I like
the most is the efficiency for faster transactions. How come? You see,
blockchain technology is decentralized while the traditional transaction is
centralized. Let’s take sending money overseas for example. For a centralized
bank the transaction would take about a week for it to be fully processed, and
in terms of an emergency transaction, this wouldn’t be a great case, while the
blockchain technology provides the total opposite. Being decentralized, the
transaction would only take about minutes to be fully processed. For the case
of bitcoin, it’s the case of lower fraud risks. Bitcoin is like a digital
wallet, but unlike a real wallet, every transaction is safe. Why? Because
during the transaction, no pieces of information is being thrown, your identity
is kept hidden for good that even hackers can’t get their hands on in any way.</span></p>

<p class=Default style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>One of the many unfavors I’ve found about blockchain
technology is that of private keys. I mean don’t get me wrong, the private key
is one of the most secure key because even though many people know your public
key, your private key wouldn’t be easy to get because you are the only one who
have access to that private key unless otherwise you have told other people
about it. The main problem is that, what if, hypothetically speaking, you’ve
forget one letter of your private key. Then it would mean that you can’t access
your assets and we aren’t talking about can’t accessing for the mean time but
for the rest of your life – since there is no way to recover what had been
lost. As for bitcoin, it carries a lot of risk for loss. Because a millionaire
can become penniless in seconds with no way of recovering, since bitcoin has no
room for human or technological errors. Every transaction must be slowly yet
surely.</span></p>

policy at your place of employment or study. Is it a good policy? Does it meet
the standards outlined in the chapter? </span></p>

<p class=Default style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>I would say that our current study has at least 2
information security policy taking place, even though we really didn’t written
a security policy but nevertheless, we’ve been practicing certain policies.
Firstly, password protection policy. We believed that password is an important
aspect of security, so a very easy password would likely to result in an unauthorized
access to pieces or bulk of information. In the case of our study, we implement
a hashing algorithm for our end-users passwords. Secondly, Remote Access
Policy. We are forbidden to access the server files and database remotely,
mainly because although our local network is owned by us, it does not complete
assure that we are the only one connecting to it – it could be friends, family
and even other people. It is said the remote access can boost productivity,
however, the risk would be with the system becoming more vulnerable to attacks,
in which this is not a good case, so by practicing this policy, it surely does
minimizes the system from being exposed to ground breaking damages.</span></p>
