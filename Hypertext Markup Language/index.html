                <h2>Cebu town mayor changes mind, to close cemeteries during ‘kalag-kalag’</h2>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>CEBU CITY — A day after announcing that all five cemeteries in his town would be opened on All Saints’ Day
                    and All
                    Souls’ Day </strong>, a town mayor on Camotes Islands in Cebu province has decided to toe the line and follow
                the directive of the
                Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mayor Manuel Santiago of Pilar town declared on Friday that he would comply with the DILG order to close down the
                cemeteries in the town during the “kalag-kalag” (Nov. 1 and Nov. 2) commemoration, saying he changed his mind after
                talking to the police.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I was told that my executive order to open our cemeteries on Nov. 1 and Nov. 2 is incorrect,” he told the Inquirer
                over
                the phone.

                <h2>Calls persist for Duterte to suspend fuel tax collection</h2>
            </p>

            <p>
                MANILA, Philippines — What used to be a weeklong fishing trip for skipper Joseph Jeruela and his fishing crew to
                Panatag
                (Scarborough) Shoal from their hometown of Infanta, Pangasinan, has gotten shorter and shorter,
                <strong>
                    no thanks to rising fuel costs.
                </strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fishermen typically spend about 70 percent of their capital on fuel, but with recent increases in pump prices
                particularly of diesel, Jeruela’s boss who also owns the boat can only give them fuel money enough for just three
                days
                at sea.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There’s nothing you can do about it. You just get used to it,” Jeruela said in Filipino, keeping his fingers
                crossed as
                he still hoped for a good catch despite everything.

                <h2>Public transport capacity raised to 70% starting November 4</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                MANILA, Philippines — <strong>A gradual increase in passenger capacities in railways and all forms of road-based
                    public
                    transport in Metro Manila will be implemented starting Nov. 4, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) announced
                    on
                    Friday.</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The DOTr said the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) approved on
                Thursday
                the proposed initial expansion in capacity to 70 percent from the current 50 percent.

                <h2>Vaccine czar to LGUs: Rush use of 38M doses</h2>
            </p>

            <p>
                MANILA, Philippines —
                <strong>With the arrival of more COVID-19 vaccines, the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) on
                    Friday urged local governments across the country to be “creative and flexible” in speeding up their vaccination
                    drives
                    and go house-to-house to give the jabs if they have to.</strong>

            <p>
                NTF chief implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said that as of Thursday, the country had 38 million doses of
                various
                brands of vaccines ready for distribution.

                He said 8 million were in national warehouses and 30 million in regional storage facilities. They have a shelf life

                <h2>PH still among deadliest places for journalists</h2>
            </p>

            <p>
                MANILA, Philippines — <strong>The Philippines remains one of the deadliest countries in the world for journalists
                </strong>, according to
                a global media watchdog report released on Friday, which again highlighted the dangers faced by media professionals
                working under hostile governments or weak criminal justice systems.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the annual Impunity Index issued by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which trains the
                spotlight
                on countries where journalists have been killed and the perpetrators remain free, the Philippines ranked seventh on
                the
                list, the same as last year, with 13 murders still unsolved.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These cases were cited out of the total of 85 recorded in the country between 1992 and 2021.
